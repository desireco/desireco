### Hi there, my name is Zeljko Dakic and shaping code into fantastic product is my specialty.

I am currently very interested in organizing UI into Design Systems with reusable components.

I am also very interested and experienced in helping team developers be very happy and very, very productive. It isn't easy and it doesn't happen always, but if stars align just the right way, I get teams very productive.

Another topic that I am really interested is Generative Systems, which is kind of evolution of Expert Systems I was really into during my University years. Not sure where this will take me, but it is super fun, so I am doing it. Generative system is a thing that generates a lot of alternatives in a smart way, then you get to choose which one would work for you. 

My tools of choice at the moment are: Javascript/Typescript, React, Svelte, Elixir and Phoenix, NextJS, TailWinds. Fantastic Ruby and Rails, kind of fell out of fashion, it makes me sad, but it is how things are.

Another topic I am very much interested in is Knowledge Management and Zettelkasten System of notes specifically. 

If you need me, you can reach me at zeljko at hey dot com. Or same at gmail.
