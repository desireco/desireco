### Hi there, my name is Zeljko (Jake) Dakic and shaping code into amazing products is my specialty.

I am currently very interested in applications of AI, how it affects and makes developers productive. I love UI and organizing components of the interface in Design Systems.

I am also very interested and experienced in helping team developers be very happy and very, very productive. It isn't easy and it doesn't happen always, but if stars align just the right way, I get teams very productive.

My current technical passion is the application of AI technology. This feels like the natural evolution of the Generative and Expert Systems I was really into during my University years. It is not just about the hype; it is about building systems that generate smart alternatives in a useful way, allowing us to choose the best path forward. I'm not sure where this will take me, but the practical application of these tools is super fun, so I am diving deep into it.

My tools of choice at the moment are: Javascript/Typescript, React, Svelte, Elixir and Phoenix, NextJS, Ruby and Rails.

Another topic I am very much interested in is Knowledge Management and Zettelkasten System of notes specifically. I like to meditate and am very interested in creative methods and how to stimulate people to have more ideas and live better lives.
